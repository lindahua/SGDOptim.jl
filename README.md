## Overview

This package aims to provide a rich API as the basis for implementing and testing stochastic gradient descent and its variants, which are among the most widely used techniques for machine learning on large-scale datasets.

Here is an example that illustrates how this package can be used to solve a regression problem:

```julia

# prepare experimental data

# let d be the sample dimension
#     n be the number of samples

# prepare experimental data
d = length(θ_g)
X = randn(d, n)
y = vec(θ_g'X) + σ * randn(n)

# initialize solution
θ_0 = zeros(d)

# optimize
θ = sgd(sqrloss!, θ_0,
    SampleSeq(X, y, randperm(n)),  # a stream of samples, with random permuted order
    cbctrl=ByInterval(100),        # invoke the callback every 100 iteration
    callback=simple_trace     # callback: print the optimization trace when invoked
)

```

From this example, we can see that an SGD optimization procedure involves multiple aspects:

- The optimization algorithm: ``sgd`` indicates the use of the standard SGD. The package also provides other algorithms.

- The loss function: ``sqrloss!`` is a functor, which indicates that we use *squared loss*.

- The data stream, which is given by both the sample set ``X`` and ``y``, as well as the order of supplying the samples.

  **Note:** with the streaming facilities provided by the package, one can supply the data as mini-batches instead of on a per-sample basis.

- The callback mechanism that enables the interoperability with the world. Particularly, we use an ``cbctrl`` option to control how frequently the callback is invoked, and the ``callback`` option to actually supply the callback.
